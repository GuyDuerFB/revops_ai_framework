# RevOps AI Framework V2 - Execution Agent

The Execution Agent is responsible for carrying out actions determined by the Decision Agent within the RevOps AI workflow.

## Overview

The Execution Agent serves as the action implementation component of the RevOps AI Framework. It takes decisions from the Decision Agent and converts them into concrete actions within the RevOps workflow.

## Current Capabilities

The Execution Agent is in early development. Its current implementation focuses on:

- Receiving decisions from the Decision Agent
- Understanding the appropriate actions to take
- Executing basic actions within the RevOps workflow

## Integration

The Execution Agent is designed to work with AWS Bedrock and integrate with the other agents in the RevOps AI Framework.

## Deployment

The agent is deployed through Terraform configuration in the `deployment/terraform/modules/agent` directory, which sets up the AWS Bedrock agent with the appropriate resources and permissions.

Future enhancements to the Execution Agent capabilities are documented in the main ROADMAP.md file.
