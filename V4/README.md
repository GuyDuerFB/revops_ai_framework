# RevOps AI Framework V4

**Enterprise-grade AI-powered Revenue Operations Framework built on Amazon Bedrock with Specialized Agent Architecture**

## Project Goal

The RevOps AI Framework is a comprehensive, AI-powered revenue operations platform designed to revolutionize how revenue teams analyze data, assess leads, manage deals, and optimize business performance. Built on Amazon Bedrock with a multi-agent architecture, it provides intelligent automation and insights across the entire revenue lifecycle.

## What This System Does

### For RevOps Teams
This system acts as your intelligent assistant for revenue operations. Instead of manually analyzing data across multiple systems, you can simply ask questions in plain English through Slack and get comprehensive answers. The system automatically pulls data from your Firebolt Data Warehouse, Salesforce CRM, and Gong call recordings to provide complete insights about customers, deals, and revenue performance.

### Technical Implementation (V4 Architecture)
The V4 system uses a **specialized agent architecture** with **Claude 3.7**:

- **Manager Agent**: Routes requests to appropriate specialists or handles simple queries directly
- **Deal Analysis Agent**: Evaluates deal probability and risk using MEDDPICC methodology and SQL queries
- **Lead Analysis Agent**: Assesses lead quality against ICP criteria and creates engagement strategies
- **Data Agent**: Executes SQL queries against Firebolt, retrieves Salesforce records, and fetches Gong call data
- **WebSearch Agent**: Gathers external company intelligence and market research
- **Execution Agent**: Sends notifications, triggers webhooks, and updates CRM systems

This architecture delivers faster, more accurate analysis through specialized agents with direct data access.

## Solution Overview

### Core Problem Solved
Revenue teams struggle with:
- Manual analysis of vast amounts of customer and prospect data
- Time-intensive lead qualification and assessment processes
- Fragmented insights across multiple data sources (Firebolt Data Warehouse, Salesforce, Gong)
- Reactive rather than proactive revenue management
- Inconsistent decision-making processes

### Our Solution
An intelligent AI framework that:
- Automates complex revenue operations analysis using specialized AI agents
- Provides real-time insights from multiple data sources
- Enables natural language interactions through Slack integration with conversation continuity
- Delivers consistent, data-driven recommendations for revenue optimization
- Scales seamlessly with enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure

## Architecture Overview

### V4 Specialized Agent Architecture with Conversation Continuity

**🆕 Native Conversation Memory**: V4 now includes AWS Bedrock Agent Memory for seamless conversation continuity within Slack threads, allowing users to ask follow-up questions without re-explaining context while maintaining strict privacy boundaries between users and conversations.

**🔥 Real-time Agent Narration**: Experience live agent reasoning with intelligent thought process display. Instead of generic "analyzing..." messages, users see contextual narration like "🧠 Analyzing your request about the IXIS deal..." → "📊 Getting latest data from systems..." → "⚠️ Evaluating competitive risks..." providing full transparency into AI decision-making.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues Resolution
- **Bedrock Agent Access Denied**: Ensure `AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForAgents_TCX9CGOKBR` role exists with proper permissions
- **Decision Agent Action Groups**: Verify agent has NO action groups (should use collaborators only)
- **Model Compatibility**: Check agent alias points to version using `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`
- **Lambda Permissions**: Verify `revops-slack-bedrock-processor` role has `bedrock:InvokeAgent` permission

#### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check Slack integration flow
cd integrations/slack-bedrock-gateway
python3 tests/test_integration.py

# Monitor processor Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/revops-slack-bedrock-processor --follow --profile FireboltSystemAdministrator-740202120544

# Verify Decision Agent configuration
aws bedrock-agent get-agent --agent-id TCX9CGOKBR --profile FireboltSystemAdministrator-740202120544 --region us-east-1
```

#### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor Lambda cold starts and memory usage
- Check API Gateway response times
- Verify SQS queue processing rates
- Track Bedrock Agent response times
