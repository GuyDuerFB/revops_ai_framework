- **Recognition**: Monthly/quarterly billing aligned with contract terms
- **Key Metrics**: 
  - ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
  - Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
  - Contract utilization vs actual consumption
  - Expansion revenue from increased usage

### PLG Customer Revenue  
- **Growth Revenue Source**: 15-25% of total revenue
- **Characteristics**: Variable, consumption-based, leading indicator
- **Recognition**: Pay-as-you-go billing based on actual usage
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Monthly spending velocity
  - Usage growth trends
  - Conversion readiness indicators
  - Time to reach conversion thresholds

### Prospect Revenue
- **Pipeline Revenue**: 0% current, represents future potential
- **Characteristics**: Credit consumption, trial usage patterns
- **Recognition**: Minimal billing, credit burn tracking
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Trial conversion rates
  - Credit consumption velocity
  - Time to first paid usage
  - Pipeline opportunity values

## Revenue Analysis Rules

### Monthly Revenue Trends
- **Commit Customers**: Focus on retention and expansion patterns
- **PLG Customers**: Track spending acceleration and conversion signals
- **Prospects**: Monitor trial effectiveness and pipeline health

### Quarterly Revenue Analysis
- **Q-over-Q Growth**: Separate Commit expansion vs PLG conversion contributions
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Account for enterprise buying cycles and budget cycles
- **Conversion Impact**: Measure PLG→Commit upgrades on quarterly revenue

### Year-over-Year Analysis
- **Cohort Analysis**: Track customer lifetime value by acquisition type
- **Retention Analysis**: Compare commit customer longevity vs PLG stickiness
- **Growth Attribution**: Organic expansion vs new customer acquisition

## Revenue Forecasting Logic

### Commit Customer Forecasting
- **Renewal Probability**: Based on usage trends and engagement patterns
- **Expansion Likelihood**: Consumption growth indicating upsell potential
- **Churn Risk**: Declining usage or support escalations
- **Contract Timing**: Renewal dates and expansion opportunity windows

### PLG Customer Forecasting
- **Conversion Probability**: Spending velocity and usage consistency
- **Timeline Predictions**: Average 127 days from PLG start to Commit conversion
- **Threshold Indicators**: $2K+ monthly spend, 90+ day usage, multi-user adoption
- **Success Patterns**: Feature adoption depth and technical integration level

### Pipeline Revenue Forecasting
- **Trial Conversion Rates**: Historical prospect→PLG conversion (typically 12-15%)
- **Credit Consumption Patterns**: Fast credit burn indicates higher engagement
- **Sales Cycle Length**: Enterprise deals 3-6 months, SMB deals 1-3 months
- **Competitive Win Rates**: Varies by deal size and vertical
