# Conversion Funnels and Customer Lifecycle Progression

## Customer Lifecycle Stages

### Prospect Stage
- **Entry Point**: Registration, trial signup, free credits activation
- **Duration**: 30-90 days typically
- **Key Activities**: Product evaluation, proof-of-concept, technical assessment

- **Success Metrics**: Monthly spend growth, query consistency, user expansion
- **Exit Criteria**: Commit deal signing (→Commit) OR usage decline/churn

### Commit Stage
- **Entry Point**: Formal contract signature and committed spend agreement
- **Duration**: Ongoing with renewal cycles (typically 12-24 month contracts)
- **Key Activities**: Production usage, optimization, expansion, renewal preparation
- **Success Metrics**: Usage vs commitment, efficiency trends, satisfaction scores
- **Exit Criteria**: Contract renewal (positive) OR churn (negative)
